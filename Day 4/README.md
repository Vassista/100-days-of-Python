- **Concepts Learned:**
  - Working with lists and nested lists in Python.
  - Understanding how to access and modify elements in a nested list structure.
  - Basic concepts of a 2D grid and how to visualize it in terms of rows and columns.

## Heads or Tails
- **File:** `Day 4/heads or tails.py`
- **Concepts Learned:**
