# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** challenge! In this journey, I will be coding in Python, starting from absolute zero to advanced level concepts. This repository will serve as a log of my progress, with daily updates and code snippets.

## Day 1
I used the simple print function to create a band name generator. This exercise demonstrates the use of string concatenation.
