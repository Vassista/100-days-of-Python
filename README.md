# 100 Days of Python

Welcome to my **100 Days of Python** challenge! In this journey, I will be coding in Python, starting from absolute zero to advanced level concepts. This repository will serve as a log of my progress, with daily updates and code snippets.

## Day 1
##### Band Name Generator
I used the simple print function to create a band name generator. This exercise demonstrates the use of string concatenation.

## Day 2
##### Sum of digits
I wrote a program that adds the digits in a 2-digit number. This exercise demonstrates the use of string indexing and basic arithmetic operations in Python.

##### BMI Calculator
I created a BMI (Body Mass Index) calculator. This exercise demonstrates the use of mathematical operations, type conversion, and the `round` function in Python.

##### Life In Weeks
I wrote a Python program to calculate how many weeks are left in a person's life. This exercise demonstrates the use of arithmetic operations and f-strings in Python.

##### Tip Calculator
I wrote a program to calculate how much each person should pay when splitting a bill, including a tip. This exercise demonstrates the use of# arithmetic operations, type conversion and formatting the result to n decimal places in Python.
